I hear it when it rains.
I hear it when it’s quiet.
I hear it when I close my eyes.

It won’t stop.

I tried numbers.
I tried names.
Nothing works.

Only three words stay.
They don’t leave.
They don’t change.

I see it when I sleep.
I see it in the drain.
I see it smiling.

If I write it enough times maybe it will let me go.
If I write it enough times maybe it will float away.

I’m not insane.
I’m not.
I’m not.

They all float.
